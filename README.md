  Made with OpenCV and Cuda, written in C++
  </p>

### Summary of the project
`A* pathfinding algorithm` (a.k.a. A* searching algorithm) written in `C++`

This is an widely used *pathfinding and searching algorithm*; learn more about A* at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm).

**OpenCV** is not necessarily required, provided that you have found another way to convert input images into arrays which have the same format used in the example.

#### Since there might still be some problems in my implementation, so please feel free to give me any advice!

So here is the result of what I made. I hope you will have fun with it!

**Note :** There is some code in the project that creates a merged frame from 2 images. We are using a camera which can't take the whole environment. For more informations about the camera, visit https://www.axis.com/fr-ca.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have following installed:

  - [Visual Studio Community 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
  
  - [Cuda (Compute Unified Device Architecture)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

## Compile and run

As simple as:

```c++
1. Open the project in VS.
2. Execute the project.
3. Have fun !
```

or by debugging the whole program in **Visual Studio Entreprise**

## My build environment

In case you face difficulty building on your own machine, 
following is the specifications of my environment which may be 
helpful for you to spot the difference to yours.

<b>OS</b>

```text
Windows 10 2018
```

<b>OpenCV</b>

You can find the last version of OpenCV by following this [link](https://www.opencv.org/)

<b>Cuda</b>

Installing Cuda in Visual Studio is a real pain. I recommend you to use an existing project if you don't wanna waste time.
